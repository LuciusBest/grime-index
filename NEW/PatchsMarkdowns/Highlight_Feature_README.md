✅ Implemented highlight state logic and styling.
💡 Added `updateHighlightState()` in `gridManager.js` to toggle `.highlighted-player-cell` and mute other videos. Applied default grayscale filter in CSS with override for the highlighted cell.
⚠️ Needs testing across multiple player openings and closures.
📍 Next: Verify audio and visual transitions behave smoothly.

✅ Enabled manual highlight selection by clicking player cells.
💡 `updateHighlightState()` now accepts a target cell and stores the current highlight; added click listeners to player cells and CSS background tweaks.
⚠️ Controls inside players might trigger highlighting unintentionally.
📍 Next: Review interaction with Close/Next buttons and refine styles if needed.
