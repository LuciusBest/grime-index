## 2025-06-11 â€“ 15:08

ðŸ”§ Initial layout skeleton:
- Created `index.html` with `#overall-grid` container
- Added `css/layout.css` defining grid and cell styles
- Added `js/gridManager.js` with grid management functions

ðŸ§  Purpose:
Start clean rebuild with placeholder layout, separate from legacy code in `OLD/`.

## 2025-06-11 â€“ 15:10

ðŸ”§ Added changelog system:
- Created `NEW/NEW_README.md` to document development progress

ðŸ§  Purpose:
Maintain chronological record of every change while rebuilding the interface.

## 2025-06-11 â€“ 15:18

ðŸ”§ Added selector grid with placeholders:
- Updated `css/layout.css` with `.selector-grid` and grid cell styles
- Modified `js/gridManager.js` to create `selector-grid` containing 9 placeholder cells

ðŸ§  Purpose:
Prepare layout structure for future thumbnail grid integration.

## 2025-06-11 â€“ 15:24

ðŸ”§ Updated thumbnail grid styling:
- Renamed `.grid-cell` class to `.thumbnail-cell` in CSS and JS
- Added alternating gray backgrounds using `:nth-child` selectors
- Implemented hover opacity and pointer cursor

ðŸ§  Purpose:
Improve readability and interactivity of placeholder selector grid.

## 2025-06-11 â€“ 15:35

ðŸ”§ Added player-cell display logic:
- Clicking a `.thumbnail-cell` now creates a `.player-cell` displaying the same text
- `.player-cell` animates from bottom to top using CSS transitions
- Disables the selector after a thumbnail is clicked

ðŸ§  Purpose:
Showcase basic interaction flow between selector thumbnails and player area.

## 2025-06-11 â€“ 15:55

ðŸ”§ Added cell trackers and return button:
- Introduced `activeSelectorCells` and `activePlayerCells` maps in `js/gridManager.js`
- Player cells now include a `Back` button that slides them out and re-enables the selector
- Added `.return-btn` styles in `css/layout.css`

ðŸ§  Purpose:
Manage multiple cells dynamically and allow returning from the player view.

## 2025-06-11 â€“ 16:02

ðŸ”§ Fixed selector re-enable bug:
- Normalized tracker IDs as strings in `js/gridManager.js`
- Restored `pointer-events` and removed `.disabled` class when closing a player
  cell
- Added console log when a selector is re-enabled

ðŸ§  Purpose:
Ensure selectors become clickable again after closing their player cells.

## 2025-06-11 â€“ 16:18

ðŸ”§ Refactored layout for iterative growth:
- Made `.selector-cell` and `.player-cell` absolutely positioned with left/top transitions
- Added `.next-btn` styling for spawning new cell pairs
- Prepared CSS transitions for horizontal and vertical sliding

ðŸ§  Purpose:
Lay groundwork for recursive cell creation and alternating split logic.

## 2025-06-11 â€“ 16:20

ðŸ”§ Implemented recursive cell growth logic:
- Added layout stack and orientation toggle in `js/gridManager.js`
- Factored cell creation into `createSelectorCell` and `createPlayerCell`
- Player cells now feature Next buttons that spawn new selector/player pairs
- Adjusted closing logic to slide out horizontally or vertically

ðŸ§  Purpose:
Demonstrate infinite alternating layout splits triggered via Next buttons.

## 2025-06-11 â€“ 16:31

ðŸ”§ Fixed early player creation and control cleanup:
- Updated `js/gridManager.js` so Next only spawns a new selector
- Added `addPlayerControls()` helper and removed controls from previous players
- Player orientation stored with layout areas for proper animations

ðŸ§  Purpose:
Ensure players appear only when thumbnails are clicked and controls stay exclusive to the topmost cell.

## 2025-06-11 â€“ 16:38

ðŸ”§ Fixed selector stacking order:
- Set `.selector-cell` z-index to 0 and `.player-cell` to 1 in `css/layout.css`
- Added dynamic z-index assignment in `createSelectorCell` and `createPlayerCell`
  so new selectors appear above previous players

ðŸ§  Purpose:
Prevent new selector cells from being hidden behind player cells.
