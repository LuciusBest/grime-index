## 2025-06-12 – 13:37

✅ Initialized log file for Focus feature development.
💡 Strategy: Document each step chronologically before any implementation.
⚠️ No issues yet.
📍 Next: Await instructions on feature requirements and architecture.

✅ Added initial Focus button and core logic.
💡 Introduced `focusPlayerCell()` with helper steps to close siblings,
   promote the chosen cell and reset the layout.
⚠️ Uses a simplified approach; IDs are reset which may need refinement.
📍 Next: Verify that Back/Next still operate correctly after focusing.
