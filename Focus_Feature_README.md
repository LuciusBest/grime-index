# Focus Feature Development Log

## 2025-06-12 – 13:37

✅ Initialized log file for Focus feature development.
💡 Strategy: Document each step chronologically before any implementation.
⚠️ No issues yet.
📍 Next: Await instructions on feature requirements and architecture.

✅ Added initial Focus button and core logic.
💡 Introduced `focusPlayerCell()` with helper steps to close siblings,
   promote the chosen cell and reset the layout.
⚠️ Uses a simplified approach; IDs are reset which may need refinement.
📍 Next: Verify that Back/Next still operate correctly after focusing.
## 2025-06-12 – 14:15

✅ Added cascadePromote to move focused cell upward smoothly.
💡 Reverse Back logic, iteratively replacing parents after closing children.
⚠️ Needs testing with various layouts to ensure transitions remain smooth.
📍 Next: Verify focus maintains Next/Back flow after reset.

✅ Fixed lingering selector when focusing a player.
💡 cascadePromote now removes the target player's selector before promoting.
⚠️ Confirm that selector animations complete without glitches on varied grids.
📍 Next: fine-tune timing so focus feels responsive yet smooth.

## 2025-06-12 – 15:30

✅ Removed focused player's selector immediately on focus.
💡 Applied the cleanup logic from `closeSelectorCell` without animation.
⚠️ LayoutStack adjustments need further verification.
📍 Next: Test focus with multiple nested cells.

## 2025-06-12 – 16:10

✅ Splitter removed when promoting a player.
✅ Preserved selector-cell-0 during cascade promotions.
💡 Guard clauses skip selector removal at index 0 and disable it temporarily instead.
⚠️ Needs verification across complex layouts.
📍 Next: ensure focus transition keeps controls responsive.

## 2025-06-12 – 17:00

✅ Synchronized removal of splitters and selectors with player transitions.
💡 closePlayerCell now closes the linked selector at the same time and updates layoutStack once.
💡 cascadePromote starts closing parent selectors before moving and cleans them in the same callback.
⚠️ Review cascading delays to ensure smooth focus animations.
📍 Next: validate on complex grids and check root selector behavior.

## 2025-06-12 – 18:00

✅ Parents close sequentially during focus cascade.
💡 cascadePromote now waits for each player and selector pair to finish closing before moving upward.
⚠️ Root selector remains disabled after the root player closes.
📍 Next: monitor for timing issues on slower devices.
