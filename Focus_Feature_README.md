✅ Added initial Focus button and core logic.
💡 Introduced `focusPlayerCell()` with helper steps to close siblings,
   promote the chosen cell and reset the layout.
⚠️ Uses a simplified approach; IDs are reset which may need refinement.
📍 Next: Verify that Back/Next still operate correctly after focusing.

✅ Added cascadePromote to move focused cell upward smoothly.
💡 Reverse Back logic, iteratively replacing parents after closing children.
⚠️ Needs testing with various layouts to ensure transitions remain smooth.
📍 Next: Verify focus maintains Next/Back flow after reset.
